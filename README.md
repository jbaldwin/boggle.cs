Boggle Solver
===============

Solves boggle boards.

Uses a simple prefix tree like implementation to check paths in the boggle grid for words.  Multi-threaded through the default solver.

Default dictionary is the enable1 dictionary under the res/ folder.

Example weighted boards (harder to solve) are included in the res/ folder, my boggle solver can create random boards but no weighted boards yet.
